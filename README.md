# Big Data in Dairy

## Project Overview
This project explores the vast volumes of underutilized data generated by dairy production systems (cow and goat). By integrating this data with other sources such as environmental (climate) conditions, this project aims to uncover potential relationships and drivers of production output.

### Key Objectives
- Gain insights into dairy animal production and the current issues it faces including environmental challenges, productivity pressures, and the drive to reduce emissions.
- Use existing data to generate meaningful insights that can help producers and researchers improve production efficiency and sustainability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with data analysis and manipulation.
- Basic understanding of environmental impacts on agricultural outputs.
